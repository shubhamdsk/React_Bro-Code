* props: read-only properties that are shared between components
        A parent component can send data to a child component
        <component key=value >

* propTypes - a mechanism that ensures that the passed value is of the correct data types
              import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

//age : PropTypes.number 
fun_name.propTypes={
age : PropTypes.number,
name : PropTypes.string,
}

* defaultProps - default values for props in case they are not passed from the parent component
		e.g name = "Rohit"
